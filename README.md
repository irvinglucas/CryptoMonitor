### General info

This project allows the user to track down crypto prices and convert them to a local or strange 
money. It consists of a screen that shows us a cryptocoin and then a list of other types of 
money. The screen will be real-time updated, without the need to hit a button. To do this,
I'm applying some *reactive programming*.

This app has the purpose of training and studying the Android development platform. I want to 
become an Android developer, so this is the very first work I'm doing to learn.

So, as this app is under construction, feel free to open issues or make some PR`s to this repo üòå

Every improvement or tip is really welcome üòÅ

### Technologies

* Java
* Android SDK (API 32)
* RxJava (for reactive programming)


Note: this application is likely to changes, so if you want to track these changes, just watch 
this repo and you'll be ok :P
